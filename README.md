# Predicting-Survival-on-Titanic-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques

This project applies various machine learning techniques to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. It includes data preprocessing, extensive feature engineering, model training (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, etc.), hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble methods like soft voting and stacking. The goal is to improve predictive accuracy using a clean ML pipeline and explainable AI tools.
